Margaret Atwood will join the UC Santa Cruz community for a free, live, virtual event on Tuesday September 22 at 4:30 PM PT. Part of The Humanities Institute’s Deep Read Program, this event culminates months of in-depth programming and community engagement focused on Atwood’s latest Booker Prize-winning novel, The Testaments, a sequel to her 1985 classic The Handmaid’s Tale.
