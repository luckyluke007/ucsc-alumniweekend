### Join us for Alumni Weekend 2020! Friday, April 3–Sunday, April 5.

Spread the word by inviting your classmates and friends to join us in April. With so many fun events happening, we don’t want any Slugs to miss out! 

### Be an Alumni Weekend Volunteer

We need a group of proud Banana Slugs to help with our outreach efforts leading up to the weekend by personally inviting old friends and classmates to join you at Alumni Weekend.

**Reach out to your network via email** – If picking up a pen and writing a postcard is not your style, why not send old friends and classmates personal emails inviting them to Alumni Weekend? Let us know who you would like to get in touch with and we’ll help you connect. We even have some sample language we can share to help get you started.

**[Send an e-postcard](https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&gid=1001&pgid=3464&cid=6988)** – We’re excited to announce a new way to easily invite your friends to come to Alumni Weekend.
