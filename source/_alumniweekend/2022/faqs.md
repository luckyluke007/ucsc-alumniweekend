### General questions

**Q: Will all the events be in person this year?**

**A:** This year will be a hybrid Alumni Week with events offered virtually and in person. [Check out the list of events for details for each event](https://calendar.ucsc.edu/alumni_week). 

**Q: What platform will be used for virtual events?**

**A:** We will be using Zoom for all virtual events hosted throughout the week. You will need to register for each event you would like to attend, and you will receive an individual Zoom login via email for each event. 

**Q: Will all the events be recorded? How can I access them?**

**A:** Most of the events throughout the week will be recorded. You will receive an email with links to the videos. 

**Q: What is the COVID-19 protocol for on-campus events?**

**A:** UC Santa Cruz has [COVID-19 guidelines](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/assets/images/Event-Meeting-and-Visitor-COVID-19-Protocol.pdf) for on-campus visitors and guests. When you arrive at the event, please provide the following: 
- Proof of vaccination OR a recent negative COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of the start of the event (must be a lab PCR test; home tests/antigen tests are not valid).
- Email confirmation for completing the [UC Santa Cruz symptom checker](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_24vMSiDcxZp6VRX) (this should be completed the day you come to campus).

**Q: Do I have to pay for parking?**

**A:** Complimentary parking will be available in the [East Remote parking lot](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=882#!m/337747) with continuous shuttle service from 9:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. The shuttles will be able to take you to all of your events throughout the day. Disability Van service will also be available by request.

If you do decide to park at your event location on campus, you will have to pay for your parking. You can do this by purchasing a special one-day parking permit for $5 (bring cash!) in the [Barn Theatre lot 122](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=882#!m/347160) at the base of campus. Parking can also be paid for at various ParkMobile stations across campus. We suggest downloading the [ParkMobile app](https://parkmobile.io) on your phone before you arrive if you plan to use this option. 

**Q: Where can I find campus maps?**

**A:** [Click here to access campus maps](https://www.ucsc.edu/visit/maps-directions.html).
