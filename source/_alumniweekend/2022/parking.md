Complimentary parking will be available in the East Remote parking lot with continuous shuttle service from XX a.m. until XX p.m. The shuttles will be able to take you to all of your events throughout the day. 

If you do decide to park at your event location on campus, you will have to pay at the ParkMobile stations when you arrive. We suggest downloading the ParkMobile app on your phone before you arrive.
