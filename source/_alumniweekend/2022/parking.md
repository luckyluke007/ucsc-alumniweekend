Complimentary parking will be available in the [East Remote parking lot](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=882#!m/337747) with continuous shuttle service from 9:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. The shuttles will be able to take you to all of your events throughout the day. Disability Van service will also be available by request.

If you do decide to park at your event location on campus, you will have to pay for your parking. You can do this by purchasing a special one-day parking permit for $5 (bring cash!) in the [Barn Theatre lot 122](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=882#!m/347160) at the base of campus. Parking can also be paid for at various ParkMobile stations across campus. We suggest downloading the [ParkMobile app](https://parkmobile.io) on your phone before you arrive if you plan to use this option.
