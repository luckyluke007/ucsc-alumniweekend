Complimentary parking will be available at various college lots throughout campus. Lots will either be open and available to park free of charge or an attendant will be on site to provide you with a complimentary parking pass. If you would like to park at other locations around campus, you may have to pay for parking. There are ParkMobile stations available across campus and we suggest downloading the ParkMobile app on your phone before arriving.
