Complimentary parking will be available in the [East Remote parking lot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/East+Remote+Parking+Lot/@36.9914747,-122.0532138,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0xac0b24e582e8aa4e!2sEast+Remote+Parking+Lot!8m2!3d36.9910462!4d-122.0531602!3m4!1s0x0:0xac0b24e582e8aa4e!8m2!3d36.9910462!4d-122.0531602) with continuous shuttle service from 9:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m running to the campus quarry. The shuttles are running throughout the day as a part of Banana Slug Day - an event for admitted students to UCSC. Disability Van service will also be available by request.

If you do decide to park at your event location on campus, you will have to pay for your parking if required as many of the parking lots are free on the weekend. Parking can also be paid for at various ParkMobile stations across campus. We suggest downloading the [ParkMobile app](https://parkmobile.io/) on your phone before you arrive if you plan to use this option.
