We are honored to share that alumni who graduated in 1973 or before have given a collective total of over $28 million in support of UC Santa Cruz. Pioneer alumni are tremendous supporters. Over 60% of founding alumni have made a financial gift to the university. We are grateful for your dedication and philanthropic spirit.

In honor of your 50th reunion milestone, please consider making a gift to support an area of campus that left an imprint on you. Places to consider supporting include:

- Your college, the place you once called home as a living learning community
- The Student Success Initiative to support current students
- UCSC fund, providing resources for the University to fund its central priorities
